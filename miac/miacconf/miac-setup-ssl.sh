# ### Seed /dev/urandom
#
# /dev/urandom is used by various components for generating random bytes for
# encryption keys and passwords:
#
# * TLS private key (see `ssl.sh`, which calls `openssl genrsa`)
# * DNSSEC signing keys (see `dns.sh`)
# * our management server's API key (via Python's os.urandom method)
# * Roundcube's SECRET_KEY (`webmail.sh`)
#
# Why /dev/urandom? It's the same as /dev/random, except that it doesn't wait
# for a constant new stream of entropy. In practice, we only need a little
# entropy at the start to get going. After that, we can safely pull a random
# stream from /dev/urandom and not worry about how much entropy has been
# added to the stream. (http://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/) So we need
# to worry about /dev/urandom being seeded properly (which is also an issue
# for /dev/random), but after that /dev/urandom is superior to /dev/random
# because it's faster and doesn't block indefinitely to wait for hardware
# entropy. Note that `openssl genrsa` even uses `/dev/urandom`, and if it's
# good enough for generating an RSA private key, it's good enough for anything
# else we may need.
#
# Now about that seeding issue....
#
# /dev/urandom is seeded from "the uninitialized contents of the pool buffers when
# the kernel starts, the startup clock time in nanosecond resolution,...and
# entropy saved across boots to a local file" as well as the order of
# execution of concurrent accesses to /dev/urandom. (Heninger et al 2012,
# https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.conference.pdf) But when memory is zeroed,
# the system clock is reset on boot, /etc/init.d/urandom has not yet run, or
# the machine is single CPU or has no concurrent accesses to /dev/urandom prior
# to this point, /dev/urandom may not be seeded well. After this, /dev/urandom
# draws from the same entropy sources as /dev/random, but it doesn't block or
# issue any warnings if no entropy is actually available. (http://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/)
# Entropy might not be readily available because this machine has no user input
# devices (common on servers!) and either no hard disk or not enough IO has
# ocurred yet --- although haveged tries to mitigate this. So there's a good chance
# that accessing /dev/urandom will not be drawing from any hardware entropy and under
# a perfect-storm circumstance where the other seeds are meaningless, /dev/urandom
# may not be seeded at all.
#
# The first thing we'll do is block until we can seed /dev/urandom with enough
# hardware entropy to get going, by drawing from /dev/random. haveged makes this
# less likely to stall for very long.

# -------------------------------------------

# Create an RSA private key, a self-signed SSL certificate, and some
# Diffie-Hellman cipher bits, if they have not yet been created.
#
# The RSA private key and certificate are used for:
#
#  * DNSSEC DANE TLSA records
#  * IMAP
#  * SMTP (opportunistic TLS for port 25 and submission on ports 465/587)
#  * HTTPS
#
# The certificate is created with its CN set to the PRIMARY_HOSTNAME. It is
# also used for other domains served over HTTPS until the user installs a
# better certificate for those domains.
#
# The Diffie-Hellman cipher bits are used for SMTP and HTTPS, when a
# Diffie-Hellman cipher is selected during TLS negotiation. Diffie-Hellman
# provides Perfect Forward Secrecy.

# Generate a new private key.
#
# The key is only as good as the entropy available to openssl so that it

# is seeded on first use with (on Linux) 32 bytes read from /dev/urandom,
# the process ID, user ID, and the current time in seconds. [During key
# generation OpenSSL] mixes into the entropy pool the current time in seconds,
# the process ID, and the possibly uninitialized contents of a ... buffer
# ... dozens to hundreds of times."
#
# A perfect storm of issues can cause the generated key to be not very random:
#
#   * improperly seeded /dev/urandom, but see system.sh for how we mitigate this
#   * the user ID of this process is always the same (we're root), so that seed is useless
#   * zero'd memory (plausible on embedded systems, cloud VMs?)
#   * a predictable process ID (likely on an embedded/virtualized system)
