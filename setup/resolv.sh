# ### Local DNS Service

# Install a local recursive DNS server --- i.e. for DNS queries made by
# local services running on this machine.
#
# (This is unrelated to the box's public, non-recursive DNS server that
# answers remote queries about domain names hosted on this box. For that
# see dns.sh.)
#
# The default systemd-resolved service provides local DNS name resolution. By default it
# is a recursive stub nameserver, which means it simply relays requests to an
# external nameserver, usually provided by your ISP or configured in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.
#
# This won't work for us for three reasons.
#
# 1) We have higher security goals --- we want DNSSEC to be enforced on all
#    DNS queries (some upstream DNS servers do, some don't).
# 2) We will configure postfix to use DANE, which uses DNSSEC to find TLS
#    certificates for remote servers. DNSSEC validation *must* be performed
#    locally because we can't trust an unencrypted connection to an external
#    DNS server.
# 3) DNS-based mail server blacklists (RBLs) typically block large ISP
#    DNS servers because they only provide free data to small users. Since
#    we use RBLs to block incoming mail from blacklisted IP addresses,
#    we have to run our own DNS server. See #1424.
#
# systemd-resolved has a setting to perform local DNSSEC validation on all
# requests (in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, set DNSSEC=yes), but because it's
# a stub server the main part of a request still goes through an upstream
# DNS server, which won't work for RBLs. So we really need a local recursive
# nameserver.
#
# We'll install `bind9`, which as packaged for Ubuntu, has DNSSEC enabled by default via "dnssec-validation auto".
# We'll have it be bound to 127.0.0.1 so that it does not interfere with
# the public, recursive nameserver `nsd` bound to the public ethernet interfaces.
#
# About the settings:
#
# * Adding -4 to OPTIONS will have `bind9` not listen on IPv6 addresses
#   so that we're sure there's no conflict with nsd, our public domain
#   name server, on IPV6.
# * The listen-on directive in named.conf.options restricts `bind9` to
#   binding to the loopback interface instead of all interfaces.
# * The max-recursion-queries directive increases the maximum number of iterative queries.
#  	If more queries than specified are sent, bind9 returns SERVFAIL. After flushing the cache during system checks,
#	we ran into the limit thus we are increasing it from 75 (default value) to 100.

# MIAC abstract this

# First we'll disable systemd-resolved's management of resolv.conf and its stub server.
# Breaking the symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf means
# systemd-resolved will read it for DNS servers to use. Put in 127.0.0.1,
# which is where bind9 will be running. Obviously don't do this before
# installing bind9 or else apt won't be able to resolve a server to
# download bind9 from.
# Overwrite resolv.conf because some VMs bind-mount it, making it unremoveable.
